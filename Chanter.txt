# Chanter((Title))
They are storytellers and repositories of ancient lore from myriad cultural traditions. While they have some minor talent in traditional arts of combat and soul-based magic, their true power lies in their chants and invocations. This is a homebrew class from Pillars of Eternity Game. It will work as a spontaneous spellcaster (kinda, not really)

## Key ability
## Constitution

At 1st level, your class gives you an ability boost to Constitution.

|

## Hitpoints

**6 plus your Constitution modifier**
You increase your maximum number of HP by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter.
)
## During Combat Encounters

You use magical performances to alter the odds in favor of your allies. You confidently alternate between attacks, healing, and helpful spells as needed.

## During social encounters...

You persuade, prevaricate, and threaten with ease.


## While exploring...

You’re a font of knowledge, folktales, legends, and lore that provide a deeper context
and helpful reconnaissance for the group’s adventure. Your spells and performances
inspire your allies to greater discovery and success.

## In downtime...

You can earn money and prestige with your performances, gaining a name for
yourself and acquiring patrons. Eventually, tales of your talents and triumphs might
attract other bards to study your techniques in a bardic college.
## You Might...

Have a passion for your art so strong that you forge a spiritual connection with it.
* Take point when tact and nonviolent solutions are required.
* Follow your muse, whether it’s a mysterious fey creature, a philosophical concept, a psychic force, or a deity of art or music, and with its aid learn secret lore that few others have. 

## Others Probably...

* Think you are repositories of folk knowledge and common wisdom
* Underestimate you compared to other spellcasters, believing you are little more than a foppish minstrel and overlooking the subtle power of your magic.
* Respond favorably to your social charm and abilities, but remain suspicious of your beguiling magic.

# Class Features ((+Class Features))

You gain these abilities as a Chanter. Abilities gained at higher levels list the requisite levels next to the features’ names.

## Ancestry and Background ((+Ancestry and Background))

Use the editor on the left side of the screen to create text on the right side of the screen.

## Initial Proficiencies ((++Initial Proficiencies))

At 1st level you gain a number of proficiencies, representing your basic training. These are noted at the start of this class.

### Spellcasting ((++ Spellcasting))

**You can pick between Divine and Occult.**
*Insertar texto de spellcasting*


### Heightening Spells ((++Blabla))

When you get spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-level spells. This increases the spell’s level to match the spell slot. You must have a spell in your spell repertoire at the level you want to cast in order to heighten it to that level. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain levees (page 299). The signature spells class feature lets you heighten certain spells freely.

### Cantrips ((++Blabla))

Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn’t use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is automatically heightened to half your level rounded up, which equals the highest level of spell you can cast as a bard. For example, as a 1st-level bard, your cantrips are 1st-level spells, and as a 5th-level bard, your cantrips are 3rd-level spells.

### Blabla ((++Blabla))

For the best results use the **Chrome** web browser, or a browser that uses Chromium as a base such as **Vivaldi**. Other browsers may experience issues printing or rendering.

From now on it's just some text to help formatting
-
)

This is another plain paragraph that exists. That's right. This is a bunch of letters arranged into what are known as words.

rules (
# Something about Rules ((+Rules))
Rules are very important and are a staple of any game. Always remember to include rules in the game, and this box will be useful for pointing out reminders about those rules.

Wow this text just keeps on going doesn't it. More help on using markdown can be found in the help button in the menu on the top left.

note (
# This is a fancy note. ((+Note Box))
Sometimes when there is a bunch of text it's useful to put it into different areas around the page. Maybe someone doesn't need to read this right away but it would be useful to look at after they are finished reading other text. Or maybe they'll just read it first. Who knows!
## Secondary Header
Be sure to check out what each header level has to offer in each context. There aren't styles for every header one through six, but there are usually a couple for each context.
)

|

Well here we are again. This is some normal text that I want to type out in order to make this look more interesting. I think I'm really finding a good groove here. Writing this paragraph has been a lot easier than the ones before. You can tell by how long it's getting. The next box is usually used for math.

math (
Pizza Modifier = modifier of the dough's key taste score + cheese bonus + other bonuses + penalties

When finalizing the pizza modifier value it's important to remember that each topping will change the modifier based on the pizza topping table.

# Left Sidebar ((+Left Sidebar))
Sometimes splitting the page with a sidebar that is about one third of the page wide is necessary.

## Why Though
It isn't known why this practice is so widely used. At some point in history the rule of thirds was discovered and ever since then the number three has been too powerful.

### Another Header
Sometimes the headers should look like this.
)

# Look at This

This section is good. Look at it. Look at all the words that are here. Here you can find many words

## Even More Words

One might think why not just use one of those text generators? That is a good question. One that will be answered in due time.

### Specific Words

It is believed that sometimes using words can be an effective form of communication, and furthermore precisely presenting those words in a coherent manner can be beneficial in maintaining clear intent from which those words arise.

Boy howdy, columns can even be used in here, but you should be careful with them.
)

## More Text 4th

Notice how when using a header followed by a number with a suffix like 'th' it's automatically adjusted to be on the other side of the header. Neat! I think it's neat, anyway.

Uh oh, it appears that I need a little bit more text here in order to really fill out this spot. What a pickle I've gotten myself into. At least I can rest easy that nobody will actually ever read this.

#### 1st Level ((+Feat Section))

item(
# Something Cool :a: ((+Feats))
## Feat 3
-
; uncommon,class,feat,trait
**Usage** Typed into the editor window.
-
This feat allows you to type text into the editor and have it appear here. When starting a line with bold text make sure to put two line breaks between so the hanging indent functions properly.

**Critical Success** You are the best.

**Success** You are pretty good.

**Failure** At least you tried.

You can put action symbols into here. Look here is a single action :a: wow. And then here's :aa: two actions. Now look out because we're going to :aaa: three actions. How about a :r: reaction? That is a :f: free action!

**Special** This feat is very special. It is so special that it needs some text that says special at the end of it.

# Other Formatting ((+Other Formatting))
Some other stuff that is helpful to know I think.
/
## Text Style ((++Text Style))
Make sure to remember **how to bold text** and sometimes more importantly *how to italicize*.

## Links ((++Links))
You can also use [links](http://pf2.tools) if you so desire.

## Indent ((++Indent))

What happens if you have some text here and it's just fine on its own. It's just here and there isn't any formatting needed.
    But maybe this line should start indented? When you start a line with spaces it converts the spaces into the starting indent of the paragraph.

## Image ((++Images))
What about an image? Here we go!

### Hosting
Scribe does not host images. Use [imgur](http://imgur.com) or a similar service to host images.

### Advanced Options ((Advanced))
Only advanced users are able to use the most powerful features...
-
)

## Table of Contents ((+Table of Contents))
A table of contents will be automatically generated if there are any markdown headers that are labeled using double parentheses. Throughout this example are headers that employ this technique. Using the + character at the beginning of the label will indent the links depending on the amount of + characters used. This can organize the links for more clarity.

## Label Links ((+Labels))
Markdown links can point to the same labels that the table of contents uses. For example, [this link](#other-formatting) will return to the Other Formatting section.

## Custom CSS ((+CSS))
Custom styles can be defined in a css block. For example: *The example is only visible in the editor!*

css (
/* css styles go here! */
)

Fonts and colors can be reset to a basic style by inserting the word **reset** on the first line of a document. External assets and images can not be loaded through any css styles.

## Page Numbers ((+Page Numbers))

Page numbers can be enabled by inserting the word **pagenumbers** on a single line of a document. The line will not show in the rendered document.

pagenumbers

## Content Reference ((+References))
Blocks of content can be stored with a key, and then included in other portions of the document. For example:

specialfeat {
item (
# Title
## Feat 5
-
;rare,trait,example
**Requirements** You are really cool.
-
This text can be used elsewhere in the document because it's in the block labeled 'specialfeat' using curly braces. To try this out try editing the text in this feat, and watch it magically change in both spots.
)
}

To have the text reappear elsewhere, insert the key surrounded by double curly braces. For example:

{{specialfeat}}

## Hidden Content ((+Hidden Content))

A single line with only a % character will create a hidden section at the end of the document. Everything past the line with the % will not be rendered, but can be used to store content references. For example, the following reference is stored in the hidden area.

{{hiddencontent}}

### HTML Comments ((++HTML Comments))

You can also hide content in html comments, like so:

<!--
htmlcomment {
    This text is hidden in an html comment! Edit it to watch them all change at once.
}
-->

/
{{htmlcomment}}
|
{{htmlcomment}}
|
{{htmlcomment}}
/

## External References ((+External References))

Items created using http://monster.pf2.tools, http://template.pf2.tools, and other scribe entries can be included dynamically by inserting the url to the specific item. The referred item must be set to public in order to be included.
/
For example, the monster found [here](https://monster.pf2.tools/v/9wLXpxm1) can be included:

https://monster.pf2.tools/v/9wLXpxm1
|
In addition, the item found [here](http://template.pf2.tools/v/55582QvF) can be included:

http://template.pf2.tools/v/55582QvF

-

Finally, the scribe entry found [here](https://scribe.pf2.tools/v/wMqTjphx) can be included:

https://scribe.pf2.tools/v/wMqTjphx

Be careful including other scribe documents as styles applied from them could override previously set styles.

/

## Google Fonts ((+Google Fonts))
If you want to take your custom formatting to the extreme, you can import fonts from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com). Add the fonts you want to use in your custom css using the following formatting (which is only visible in the editor.) This example imports the [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) font with 4 styles. It is then available as a font-family to use in custom css. You can add multiple fonts with each specimen placed on its own line.

fonts(
Roboto:ital,wght@0,400;0,700;1,400;1,700
)

## Sticky Note ((+Sticky Note))
You can add sticky notes to pages to keep track of whatever kind of things sticky notes keep track of!
sticky(50 218
Check this out! A sticky note can
be placed using an X and Y position
which appears relative to the page.
)

sticky(120 218
Think of the possibilities!
